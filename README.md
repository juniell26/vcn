#thesis project code2
this code is for ddos control 
using terminal to automate using the operating system raspbian and kali linux

this experimental development is complete. it did work as a make shift usage of vulvular conduit of nikola tesla in networking. therefor i conclude that the current technologies to counter ddos is still more effective and efficient than using a vulvular conduit technology or technique. since this theories id filtering data it greately affect the rate or flows of data in an organization. same as the valvular conduit functionality.
