#thesis project code2
this code is for ddos control 
using terminal to automate using the operating system raspbian and kali linux

this experimental development complete. it did work as a make shift usage of vulvular conduit of nikola tesla in networking. therefor i conclude that the current technologies to counter ddos is still more effective and efficient than using a vulvular conduit technology or technique.
